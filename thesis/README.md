## ðŸ“„ Abstract

This thesis presents a scalable, machine learning-driven framework for forecasting retail sales under both regular and promotional conditions. The study leverages XGBoost models trained on time-structured transactional data, emphasizing feature engineering, demand segmentation, and supplier/product responsiveness.

Highlights include:
- Dual-model forecasting for **normal vs. promo sales**
- Achieved **RÂ² of 0.999** (normal) and **0.975** (promo)
- Promo Sensitivity Index for SKU-level targeting
- Power BI dashboard for insight visualization
